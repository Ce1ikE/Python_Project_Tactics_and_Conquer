## quick notes
while i had a joy making this project , it was quite a naive implementation of any game implementation out there. I didn't fully grasp that i accidently implementated a finite state machine for the main game loop and didn't know about design patterns.

while you don't neccesarly always require design patterns because it does require you to have knowledge and experience for it. it sure does make your codebase much cleaner and thus maintainable.

also when it comes to OOP (object oriented programming) it is not always done correctly , such as which class should contain what data (would actually use some type of ECS pattern now).

Lastly is probably the fact that their is no UML diagram that gives a clear overview on how the project's classes interact with each other, which can give a much better understanding on how to structure your codebase before doing any coding at all
