# so first what is the "grid" class ? 
# -> Well in order to play this game you need a map.

# Well how do create a map ?
# -> You can use different methods to create a map
# most basic map creation would be a hardcoded one (but that is of course not scalable and you would need a way to store these static maps => en dat wil ik niet doen) 
# Of course we are going to use a algorithm !

# What kind of algorithm ?
# -> There are a lot to choose from but the one i am most familiar with is the "Wave function collapse" algorithm.
# If you know a little bit about physics , more particularly quantum physics , this might ring a bell. However i must tell you
# that this algorithm involves anything but physics (sorry).
# There also many (like many) more variations of this algorithm , some more straightforward , some more optimized
# Other examples:
# => https://dev.to/kavinbharathi/the-fascinating-wave-function-collapse-algorithm-4nc3
# => https://github.com/Coac/wave-function-collapse
# these are all python implementations but this algorithm has been implemented in a lot of different languages:
# => (*) https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse
#
#
# "Oskar StÃ¥lberg", you might know him (he is the guy that created "Bad North" and "Townscaper")
# i recommend you check him out (he's done a lot more since then), he implemented this functionality in his games to create different maps 
# in his game
# => https://www.tumblr.com/oskarstalberg
#
# Townscaper 
# => https://oskarstalberg.com/Townscaper/
#
# Also there are lot more different kind of algorithms 
# like i watched "Ici Amy Plant" (https://www.youtube.com/@iciamyplant) on Youtube using the "Bruit de Perlin" algorithm
# fascinating video:
# => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY4wxHPVXiQ
# here are some other procedural map generation algorithms
# => https://christianjmills.com/posts/procedural-map-generation-techniques-notes/
# 
# There is actually a nice paper by "Paul C. Merrell" on this which goes in detail on this kinds of algorithms:
# see => https://paulmerrell.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/thesis.pdf
# while he didn't called it the WFC he was the firts one describing this kind of algorithm. He named it "Model synthesis"
# it was "Maxim Gumin" who later published an implementation on Github (see link above (*)).

# How did it work out for you ?
# -> Well it was not easy at first because i started out on the wrong foot
# i started coding my tile constraints (the "rules" of the algorithm to follow) based on each possible tile that could be on the left , right , up or down of that tile:
# left      : [x,y,z,...]
# right     : [a,x,z,...]
# up        : [w,b,c,...]
# down      : [x,y,w,...]
# this quickly became a big mess and it is difficult to keep track which tile is connected to which tile
# "The Coding Train" on Youtube also started out this way actually but also realised that makes the algorithm not scalable when more then 20 tiles are involved
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM     
# The moment you realise that you have to insert the tiles edges and to check for matching tiles that have the matching edge in common in the opposite direction 
# is like magic. Once you establish this concept the understanding of the algorithm clears up.
# my implementation of the algorithm is actually based upon this guy's code however tweaked to my liking
# => https://github.com/CodingQuest2023/Algorithms/tree/main

# the algorithm goes as follows:
# ------------------------------
# (1) initiate EVERY cell in the grid with a all possible tiles in your ruleset
# this means that you assume that at the very beggining any cell can be any tile

# (2) choose a cell with the lowest "entropy" and "collapse" this cell to single tile. 
# This means we simply choose a cell with the fewest possible options and choose a random tile
# out of the options this cell has remaining. This cell will now have this tile as value 

# (3) take the "collapsed" cell's neighbouring cells and reduce the amount of possible options they have 
# based upon the edges the "collapsed" cell now has, in order to constrain the possible options the neigbouring cells have

# (4) repeat step (3) until no cell's options can constrained. This step is called "propagation"

# (5) check if all cells have only 1 option remaining. 
# If not repeat step (2), (3), (4) and (5)
# If all cells are "collapsed" the map has been generated

# !! NOTE: for step (2) steps it might be you start out with a empty grid (no seeds planted) 
# which means that any cell can be has the same "entropy" and so the same amount of chance to be "collapsed"

# there are definitly pro and cons using this algorithm
# what I would consider a pro is that it is easy to set up for someone as my with little to no game developement at all
# and it's very easy to understand
# a con would be that it's actually very expensive computational-wise. With that i mean that because of the fact you can run 
# into a contradiction and because it is difficult to see when this contradiction has occured or when the "seed" of the contradiction occured
# you are obliged to restart the whole generation. furthermore the "propagation" fase is also very expensive because evry iteration you need to go over your
# map array which isn't a problem for small maps and small project like this one. But think about this in a 3D world.(think minecraft !!)
# To generate a 3D mesh you need to increase your number of "cells" (i guess polygons in 3D) by the number of layers you would like to have.
# the paper i have linked by "Paul C. Merrell" talks about this in section 4.8.2
# and so this doesn't fit a scenario where you need a real-life update every single time you get further into the map
# also if the number of possible tiles increase and the dimensions increase as well this algorithm doesn't become as effecient as others out there
# ENJOY the "grid" class
